# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Java Project created using TDD as seen in 
Kent Beck's book "Test-Driven Development By Example".

### Goal

Clean code that works.

### The TDD cycle

1. Quickly add a test.
2. Run all tests and see the new one fail.
3. Make a little change.
4. Run all tests and see them all succeed.
5. Refactor to remove duplication.
