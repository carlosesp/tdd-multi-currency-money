# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Java Project created using TDD as seen in 
Kent Beck's book "Test-Driven Development By Example".

### Goal

Clean code that works.

### The TDD cycle

1. Quickly add a test.
2. Run all tests and see the new one fail.
3. Make a little change.
4. Run all tests and see them all succeed.
5. Refactor to remove duplication.

### Tests for the project

1. Be able to add amounts in two different currencies and convert the result
   given a set of exchange rates.
2. Be able to multiply an amount (price per share) by a number (number of shares)
   and receive an amount.

### Work based on tasks
- Make a to-do list of tasks (tests) we want to complete.
- <b>Text in bold</b> means that the task is being developed.
- <strike>Text crossed off</strike> means that the task was completed.
- New tests can be added to the list as they appear.
